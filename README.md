# AudioJAK (Jared, Alexander, Karthik)

## Abstract
The objective of this design was to create an audio visualizer that will be interfaced on a HDMI display and over a web server. Audio operations such as playing a loop, playing a section of the audio file, playing the audio file in reverse, and simple audio editing such as cutting out parts of the audio file were implemented. The audio fileâ€™s waveform along with audio file information is displayed in order to better visualize the file.
