# Initial Test Implementations

`./fortune_example` showcases an example systemd socket activation service used for potential websocket communication (this framework was ultimately not used due to issues with Zedboard-Raspberry Pi networking)

`./mongoose_ws` showcases an example Mongoose Websocket Client-Server combination that also displays an example HDMI pixel buffer data file. This also holds the initial HTML exploration with audio playing and canvas updating.

`./systemd_test` showcases a simple systemd service for running a system command (this framework was used for the final HTTP server service creation)
