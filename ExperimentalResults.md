## HDMI Display Experimental Results
The most important factor with displays is refresh rate. This was tested when under immense stress (aka refreshing as often as possible), and then normal stress (aka normal application operation).

It was found that immense stress, we were able to acheive 10.48 frames per second on average, and under normal usage we achieved 12.20 frames per second on average. We consider this satisfactory since there are not many fast or moving components which allows the application to work without a hitch.
